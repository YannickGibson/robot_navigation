# Robot Navigation (using sockets)
The task is to firstly authenticate with a robot and secondly to navigate him to desired space in 2D plane, which is the point 0,0. Along the way we encouter obstacles which we have to avoid. Also the robot may discharge and need to recharge by simulated solar charging.

I am using sockets to comunicate with a client (server).

The solution works for multiple threads.
